# TwitterWatch

Have you ever wished you could have a summary of particular accounts without reading all of their tweets? Were you ever curious who are the top fans of those accounts? Or simpler, did you ever wish you could search through an account's tweets in a csv file rather than twitter? Here, we can do all of these tasks using several lines of coding.

We first want to extract tweets from various accounts, then categorize them using sentiment analysis to positive, neutral, or negative. We then will get the latest 5000 replies and do a sentiment analysis on those too. Next, we identify the top 5 active followers of these accounts. And finally, we summarize the accounts in 1 and 2 paragraphs. This way, you will know what each accout has been mainly focused on in a particular period of time.

Here are the accounts for which we are scrapping the tweets since Feb 1st:

- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)
- Barack Obama (@BarackObama)
- Cathie Wood (@cathiedwood)
We will do all the steps separately for each one of these accounts.
